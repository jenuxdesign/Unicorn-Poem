I rode a rainbow unicorn.
We sailed across the sky.
(Iâ€™d fed him lots of rainbow Skittles and ketchup,
since they always make him fly.)

I took him to the room
I took him to the door
I took him to school
He was quite a bore
He ate lots of Skittles
Yummy Skittles
red skittles and blue skittles
He had purple wings.
He was cute.
